<p>Greetings Tim, it&rsquo;s been more than 6 months since the journey to Canada and I&rsquo;m now well settled. Thank you for your new year GIF while I choose this special way as the response, as nowadays I try to avoid posting on WeChat.</p>
<p>Life in this quaint city, which is but 3rd large one in Ontario with roughly 40k population, has been generally slow and &ldquo;classic&rdquo;: house, yard, garage, interactions mostly on phone call. As healthcare, schooling, housing and banking were all taken care of, I can finally start to integrate. Nowadays, though, people become away from another partly thanks to social media, so few &ldquo;good neighbor&rdquo; things can be done.</p>
<p>And with GDP slump and political turmoil, it&rsquo;s no longer a decade ago. I&rsquo;m not coming at a good time though no choice. Homeless is rampaging instead of affordable homes, crime rate is soaring in downtown similar to America. I can feel people are losing faith, getting detached from reality with either numbness or drug. At least for now I won&rsquo;t tell any beautiful Canadian stories to friends back in China.</p>
<p>The comparatively bright side: I can drive and travel to anywhere with drivers license plus road side service and car insurance (gee insurance is everywhere, and not cheap). Kid growing as expected in senior kindergarten to be try Eng-French school track starting at Grade1. Both finance and body are healthy and it even allows us for a trip to Niagara.</p>
<p>At last, it&rsquo;s not likely that I get back to China in recent future. Not hearing about the network service issue is good news, meaning my automation hack has been a success.<br>
Wish all the best to your family and living by the river. Good/service now are hell cheap given the deflation, but on the other side of Pacific they suck blood.</p>
